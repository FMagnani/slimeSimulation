# Agent based slime simulation

## Resources
I got inspiration from this video [https://youtu.be/X-iSQQgOd1A] of Sebastian Lague. He makes it using Unity, but his script [https://github.com/SebLague/Slime-Simulation/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Slime/SlimeSim.compute] is still useful in this framework.  
I employ Open Frameworks [https://openframeworks.cc/]. A good path for getting at this level of understanding could be given by the following resources:  
- This introduction to the concept of shader [https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/shaders.html] and the corresponding examples  
- This example [https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/gl/gpuParticleSystemExample] of a particle system, using shaders applied to textures  
- This example [https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/gl/computeShaderParticlesExample] of boids, using compute shaders  
- This example [https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/gl/fboTrailsExample] for implementing the trail map
- This good tutorial [https://maciejmatyka.blogspot.com/2022/01/compute-shaders-in-open-frameworks.html] of Maciej Matyka on compute shaders
